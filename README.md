# Anomalous Cycle Exploration

The Anomalous Cycle Exploration Script is a tool designed as a framework for identifying and exploring tests with anomalous cycle data. This script uses sklearn's 'LocalOutlerFactor' module to detect which cycles have anomalous cycle statistic data. It then allows you to see which cycles/cycle statistics are anomalous for a given test, plot the per cycle statistics with and without the anomalous data, and plot the timeseries data for a given cycle on the test record. The data for the script can be selected from a set of curated public datasets hosted on Voltaiq Community, or can be selected from a custom search criteria.
